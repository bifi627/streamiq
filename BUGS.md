### Authed shell swallows API errors
**Area:** frontend / App.tsx · **Severity:** Low (UX)

The authed shell `.catch(() => {})`-swallows `getMe()`/`getGateways()` errors — a
failed call shows an empty shell with no signal.

**Fix:** surface the error in the UI once the shell grows real content (item 5).
